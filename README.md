# servicenow-quicksearch

Copy the files manifest.json and background.js to your PC i.e. C:\<user>\ChromeExt\. Edit background.js so that the https://yourcompany.service-now.com will have your comapny's ServiceNow URL. Once done, navigate to chrome://extensions > Turn On Developer mode > Load Unpacked > Navigate to the Folder location > Select folder, that's it. It will be listed as "SnowSearch". I also added the code below.

Usage: In Chrome address bar, type, sn<SPACE><Ticket# i.e. sn RITM9999999 or sn INC1234567 or sn CHG0987654 or sn KB0018589 or sn PRB0000000> or any keyword that you're searching and [Enter]. Please take note that sn should be small letters (case sensitive).
